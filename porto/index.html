SKILLS & EXPERTISE<br>
<br>
I've been developing my skill-set to focus on what's most suited to getting the job done quickly and effectively.<br><br>
<div id="fd">
Frontend development<br>
<br>
Whether you need a new website, updates to an existing application or a bespoke email marketing shot; if it involves the web, I can certainly help.<br>

I write code that conforms to the W3C's web standards and semantic bestâ€“practices. I use technologies like HTML5, CSS3 (SCSS) and jQuery, to transform static artwork into pixel-prefect, interactive and fully functional interfaces; exactly the way your designers intended them to be.<br><br>

WordPress development<br>
<br>
I can help you leverage one of the world's most popular and powerful content management systems; tailoring it specifically to your needs.<br>

WordPress has become the simplest and quickest way for me to develop new, fully content managed websites. Sell your products online or set up a blog, either way, you'll have the ability to manage your content just the way you want to.<br><br>

Responsive web development<br>
<br>

The web is no longer just in the hands of the desktop computer. Today we have smartphones, tablets and in the near future; smart watches.<br>

How will we ensure your website looks great on multiple devices; including those that haven't even been invented yet? I build using a responsive grid system. I have experience with frontend frameworks such as Foundation, Bootstrap and Bourbon Neat to ensure that layouts are now quicker, smarter, standardised and more future-proof.<br><br>
