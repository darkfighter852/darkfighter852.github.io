    <h1>SERVICES</h1>
    <p>Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary time needed to understand your product vision. <br>
The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work.<br>
Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces you need. </p>
